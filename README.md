# pill-it-up
This is the repo for pill_it_up, a submission for Hack Cambridge 4D!

It's an Alexa Skill integrated to some hardware (Cardboard box + Raspberry Pi + Webcam) and to a GCP instance capable of telling the user what pill has been put inside the box!

The rpi branch should be cloned to the Raspberry and the cloud branch to the GCP instance.
