GP Connect is a national API developed with the NHS that allows you to view complete patient records, in structured (FHIR) and unstructured (HTML) formats. It also allows you to book and manage GP appointments.

This set of files contains the required certificates to connect to TPP's Demo server. No real patient data is provided, it is all test data.
Example messages are provided for each API. These allow you to use the API against a specific Demo GP practice.
